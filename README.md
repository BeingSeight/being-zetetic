# Being Zetetic

> The learning protocol for lifelong mastery of anything.
> Become the Being that inquires.

**Live site:** [{{SITE_URL}}](https://{{SITE_URL}})
**Made by:** [BeingSeight](https://github.com/BeingSeight) · Driven by Mnemethos
**Stack:** Static site. Zero backend. Zero build step.

---

## What this is

A static website that hosts a learning protocol in three modes:

- **Zetetic Thread** — pure thought-map. Every concept arises as a question from the previous one.
- **Zetetic Sift** — MCQ-based stream. One-liner Qs, one-liner whys.
- **Zetetic-Socratic Hybrid** — Thread + Sift alternating. Build, test, build, test.

Plus:

- A **Mnemethos** page explaining the philosophy behind the protocol.
- A **Machine Hub** with raw prompts designed to be ingested directly by AI agents.
- **Three pre-generated example documents** (Operating Systems, JavaScript Closures, Blockchain Basics) you can read right now.

The protocol is open. The prompts are public. The site has no tracking cookies, no third-party analytics, no build pipeline.

## Local development

```sh
python3 -m http.server 3000
# → http://localhost:3000/
```

Any static-file server works. There is no `npm install`, no transpiler.

## Editing the prompts

All three mode prompts live in `assets/prompts.js` under `window.BZ_PROMPTS`. The HTML pages render them via a small `document.getElementById('...').textContent = window.BZ_PROMPTS.thread` pattern, and the `[data-copy]` buttons copy them straight from that source of truth.

Edit once, updates everywhere.

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages (recommended)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare Pages, "Create application" → "Pages" → "Connect to Git".
3. Select the repo. Build command: *(none)*. Build output: `/`.
4. Deploy. Cloudflare serves `/thread` from `thread.html` natively — no `_redirects` needed.
5. Add the custom domain `{{SITE_URL}}` in the Pages project.

### Netlify

Drop the folder on Netlify, or connect via Git. The included `_redirects` file maps the clean URLs to the `.html` files.

### Vercel

`vercel deploy` from the project root. Add a `vercel.json` with the same rewrites if you want clean URLs without the `.html` extension.

### GitHub Pages

Push to `gh-pages` branch. Note: GitHub Pages does not honor `_redirects`, so the `404.html` client-side router handles clean-URL fallback.

MIT. Take the protocol, fork the site, make it your own.

Built in the open. No analytics that phone home. The protocol works because it doesn't let you fake understanding — neither does the code.
